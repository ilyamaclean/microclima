\title{Calculates net longwave radiation below canopy}
\usage{
longwaveveg(h, tc, p = 101300, n, x, fr, svv = 1, albc = 0.23, co = 1.24)
}
\arguments{
\item{h}{a single numeric value, SpatRaster object, two-dimensional array or matrix of specific humidities (\ifelse{html}{\out{kg kg<sup>{-1}</sup> }}{\eqn{kg kg^{-1}}}).}

\item{tc}{a single numeric value, SpatRaster object, two-dimensional array or matrix of temperatures (ÂºC).}

\item{p}{an optional single numeric value, SpatRaster object, two-dimensional array or matrix of sea-level pressures (Pa).}

\item{n}{a single numeric value, SpatRaster object, two-dimensional array or matrix of fractional cloud cover (range 0 - 1).
Technically assumed to be 1 - ratio of measured to clear-sky radiation.}

\item{x}{a SpatRaster object, two-dimensional array or matrix of numeric values representing the ratio of vertical to horizontal projections of leaf foliage as returned by \code{\link[=leaf_geometry]{leaf_geometry()}}.}

\item{fr}{a SpatRaster object, two-dimensional array or matrix of fractional canopy cover as returned by \code{\link[=canopy]{canopy()}}.}

\item{svv}{an optional SpatRaster object, two-dimensional array or matrix of values representing the proportion of isotropic radiation received by a surface partially obscured by topography relative to the full hemisphere underneath vegetation as returned by \code{\link[=skyviewveg]{skyviewveg()}}.}

\item{albc}{an optional single value, SpatRaster object, two-dimensional array or matrix of values representing the albedo(s) of the vegetated canopy as returned by \code{\link[=albedo2]{albedo2()}}.}

\item{co}{parameter relationship between vapor pressure and temperature near the ground Brutsaert (1975).}
}
\value{
a single numeric value, SpatRaster object or two-dimensional array of values representing net longwave radiation (MJ per metre squared per hour).
}
\description{
\code{longwaveveg} is used to calculate a high-resolution dataset of the net longwave radiation flux density emmited from the Earth, accounting for canopy effects.
}
\details{
If \code{svv} is a SpatRaster object, a SpatRaster is returned.
If no values for \code{p} are provided, a default value of 101300 Pa, typical of
sea-level pressure, is assumed. If no value for \code{albc} is provided, then
the entire area is assumed to have a default value of 0.23, typical of
well-watered grass. If single values of \code{h}, \code{tc}, \code{p}, \code{n} or
\code{albc} are given, then the entire area is assumed to have the same values.
If no value for \code{svv} is provided then the entire hemisphere is assumed to
be in view.
