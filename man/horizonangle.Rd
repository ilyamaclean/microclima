\title{Calculates the tangent of the horizon angle}
\usage{
horizonangle(dtm, azimuth, res = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{dtm}{a raster object, two-dimensional array or matrix of elevations (m). If not a raster, orientated as if derived from a raster using \code{\link[=is_raster]{is_raster()}}. I.e. \verb{[1, 1]} is the NW corner.}

\item{azimuth}{a numeric value representing the direction of the horizon as, for example, returned by \code{\link[=solazi]{solazi()}} (º from north).}

\item{res}{a single numeric value representing the spatial resolution of \code{dtm} (m).}
}
\value{
a raster object or two-dimensional array of numeric values representing the tangent of the angle to the horizon in a specified direction.
}
\description{
\code{horizonangle} is used to calculate the tangent of the angle to the horizon in a specified direction.
}
\details{
To enable calculation of horizon angles near the edge of \code{dtm} a 100 pixel buffer is of
zeros is placed around it. NAs in \code{dtm} are converted to zeros.
The projection system used must be such that units of x, y and z are identical. Use
\code{\link[=projectRaster]{projectRaster()}} to convert the projection to a Universal Transverse Mercator type
projection system. If \code{dtm} is a raster object, a raster object is returned.
}
\examples{
library(raster)
ha <- horizonangle(dtm1m, 0)
plot(ha, main = "Tangent of angle to horizon")
