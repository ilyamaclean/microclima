\title{Calculates land to sea ratio in upwind direction}
\usage{
invls(landsea, e, direction)
}
\arguments{
\item{landsea}{A raster object with NAs (representing sea) or any non-NA value (representing land). The object should have a larger extent than that for which land-sea ratio values are needed, as the calculation requires land / sea coverage to be assessed upwind outside the target area.}

\item{e}{an extent object indicating the region for which land-sea ratios are required.}

\item{direction}{an optional single numeric value specifying the direction (decimal degrees) from which the wind is blowing.}
}
\value{
a raster object with distance-weighted proportions of upwind land pixels
}
\description{
\code{invls} is used to calculate an inverse distance\ifelse{html}{\out{<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{^2}} weighted ratio of land to sea in a specified upwind direction.
}
\details{
This function calculates a coefficient of the ratio of land to
sea pixels in a specified upwind direction, across all elements of a
raster object, weighted using an inverse distance squared function,
such that nearby pixels have a greater influence on the coefficient.
It returns a raster object representing values ranging between zero
(all upwind pixels sea) to one (all upwind pixels land). Upwind
direction is randomly varied by ± \code{jitter.amount} degrees.

\examples{
library(raster)
ls1 <- invls(dtm100m, extent(dtm1m), 180)
ls2 <- invls(dtm100m, extent(dtm1m), 270)
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(ls1, main = "Land to sea weighting, southerly wind")
plot(ls2, main = "Land to sea weighting, westerly wind")
