\title{Calculates Leaf Area Index for specified height above ground}
\usage{
lai_adjust(l, veghgt, hgt = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{l}{SpatRaster object, two-dimensional array or matrix of leaf area index values as returned by \code{\link[=lai]{lai()}}.}

\item{veghgt}{a SpatRaster object, two-dimensional array or matrix of vegetation heights (m).}

\item{hgt}{a numeric value representing the height above the ground for which Leaf Area Index is required (m).}
}
\value{
a SpatRaster object or a two-dimensional area of numeric values representing the Leaf Area Index values for a specified height above the ground
}
\description{
\code{lai_adjust} is used to adjust the total one-sided area of leaf tissue per unit ground surface area to derive values at at a specified height above the ground.
}
\details{
If \code{l} is a SpatRaster object, a SpatRaster object is returned. Temperatures are often required for a specified height above the ground,
and in short vegetation, the leaf area can be substantially less at this
height than at ground level. This function enables the user to estimate
leaf area for a specified height about the ground.
}
\examples{
library(terra)
l <- lai(aerial_image[,,3], aerial_image[,,4])
la<-lai_adjust(l, rast(veg_hgt))
par(mfrow=c(2, 1))
plot(if_raster(l, dtm1m), main = "Leaf area index")
plot(if_raster(la, dtm1m), main = "Adjusted leaf area index")
}
