Description: The functions in the microclima package contain tools for 
    modelling the mechanistic processes that govern fine-scale variation in 
    temperature. It includes tools for determining local variation in 
    temperature arising from variation in radiation, wind speed, altitude, 
    surface albedo, coastal influences and cold air drainage. A series of
    functions for determining the fine-scale topographic and vegetation 
    effects on wind speed and radiation are also provided. It also includes 
    tools for deriving canopy cover, leaf architecture, surface albedo and 
    cold air drainage basins from digital elevation data and aerial imagery.
